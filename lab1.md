1. Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
![Image](ccd1.png)
- The working directory when the command was run is /home.
- The output I got was the working directory /home and I got this output because I ran cd with no arguments which goes back 1 directory. The reason cd has no arguments is because there was no argument after the command cd.
- This output is not an error.
2. Share an exmaple of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
![Image](cccd2.png)
- The working directory when the command was run is /home/lecture1
- The reason why the working directory became /home/lecture1 is because the command was ran with the argument lecture1 changing the directory to lecture1.
- The output is not an error
3. Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.
![Image](cd3.png)
- The working directory when the command was run is /home/lecture1
- The output received is "bash: cd: Hello.class: Not a directory" and working directory fo /home/lecture1. This output was received because the command cd can only be used to change the working directory.
- The output is an error because the working directory was not changed since Hello.class is a file and not a directory.

3. Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.
