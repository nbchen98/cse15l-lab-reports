- The method called in my code is handleRequest
- The relevant arguments to that method is that the url path contains "/add-message" and the query parameter equaling "s". The values of relevant fields of the class are adding 1 to num which tracks the number of the message and "Hello" which is added to the words string.
- The value of the words string changes from this request because "Hello" is added to the string which contains all the strings added and num increases by 1.
